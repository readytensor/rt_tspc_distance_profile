  "description": "This synthetic dataset is generated using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with continuous valued observations. Each sample in the dataset is a multivariate timeseries with a variable length. The dataset includes an identifier for each sample, a set of continuous observations for each timestep, and a corresponding state label for each timestep. The HMM Continuous Timeseries Dataset presents a challenging task for time step classification algorithms, where the goal is to accurately classify each timestep within the sequences based on the hidden states of the HMM.
